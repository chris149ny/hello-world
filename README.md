My spot for cs50 assignments - where it all began

Ex ship's navigator, currently a cardiac anesthesiologist under lockdown in Manhattan due to our world's most recent incarnation of the plague.

Amazon and Netflix have failed me by not having enough good TV so I'm trying to expand my horizons and maybe find a new career if this whole medicine thing doesn't work out.
